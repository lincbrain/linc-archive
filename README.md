# dandiarchive [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dandi/dandiarchive/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dandi/dandiarchive/tree/master)
Infrastructure and code for the DANDI Archive.

Folders in this repo:

- `ansible`: Ansible code for deploying `girder-dandi-archive`.
- `docker`: Docker files for building and deploying the application in Docker.
- `girder-dandi-archive`: A Girder plugin which adds the custom endpoints for the DANDI Archive.
- `test`: End-to-end tests for the entire application.
- `web`: The web application front-end, based on Vue.js.

## Developing Locally

### Server

#### Install
1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally.

2. Create a python3 virtual environment:
    ```bash
    mkvirtualenv dandiarchive --python=python3
    ```

3. Install (in editable mode) the DANDI Archive plugin to Girder:
    ```bash
    cd girder-dandi-archive
    pip install -e .
    girder build
    ```

#### Run
```bash
girder serve
```

The Girder server will run at `http://localhost:8080/`.

##### Initial Bootstrapping

1. Create an admin user, using Girder's web client:
    * Visit `http://localhost:8080/#?dialog=register`.
    * The first user created automatically becomes the admin user.

2. Create a filesystem assetstore:
    * Visit `http://localhost:8080/#assetstores`.

#### Test
```bash
# within "girder-dandi-archive"
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
tox
```

### Web App

#### Install
```bash
cd web
yarn install
```

#### Run
Ensure the server is running locally (see above), then:
```bash
# within "web"
yarn run serve
```

The web app will be served at `http://localhost:8085/`.

#### Test
```bash
# within "web"
yarn run lint
```

#### End-to-End Testing
See `test/README.md` for end-to-end testing instructions.

## Docker

Currently there is a docker-compose file which gets the necessary infrastructure up and running for dandiarchive.

In order to get up and running:

```
cd docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will spin up 4 containers:

1) MongoDB
2) Girder
3) Vue Web Client
4) Provision

Provision container creates a Girder admin user, creates a filesystem assetstore and set necessary CORS settings.
Credentials are username: admin, password: letmein.

When the provision container finishes, it will exit. The other three containers will remain running.

After docker-compose up succeeds and the provision container finishes, you should have:

1) Girder up and running on port 8091
2) Web client up and running on port 8092
3) MongoDB container up and running, and only visible to the other docker containers

## Publish

Functionality for publish is currently provided by a separate application. For local installations, you will need to install and run that application separately.  You will also need an API key to connect to publish, which can be generated by following the [API Authentication instructions](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-publish#api-authentication) in the publish README. Then, configure the following setting variables in girder:

```
dandi.publish_api_url = http://localhost:12345
dandi.publish_api_key = your_api_key
```

This can be done easily using the `PUT /system/setting` endpoint on the swagger page.
